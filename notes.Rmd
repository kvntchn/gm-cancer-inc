# Review of cancer biology (from Weinberg)

## Tumors arise from normal tissues

- Most cell types proliferate and participate in morphogenesis, so
	- They may wrongfully gain access to certain genetic information
	- Their genomic sequences may be corrupted
- When there are such perturbations, cells may undergo growth that no longer follows the "normal" rules
- Cancers are classified by presumed tissue or organ site of origin
- Cancers also classified by degree of agressiveness:
	- Those that do not invade other tissues: benign
	- Malignant otherwise
- Benign growths can also cause problems
	- Excessive hormone production
	- Pressure on neighboring sites

## Tumors arise from specialized cell types

- Most tumors arise in epithelia
- Epithelia spawn carcinomas, responsible for > 80% of caner-related deaths in West
	- Those forming protective layers spawn squamous cell carcinomas
	- Those which secrete substances spawn adenocarinomas
- Nonepithelial cells
	- Connective tissue, which spawn sarcomas
		- Includes pre-endothelial tissue, which spawn angiosarcomas
	- Blood-forming hematopoietic tissues
		- Leukemia: malignant derivatives of WBCs that move freely throughout circulation
		- Lymphoma: malignant derivatives of B and T lymphoctes, that aggregate to form masses
	- Third and last: neuroectodermal
		gliomas, glioblastomas, neruoblastomas, schwannomas, and medulloblastomas

## Special tumors (don't fit into major types)

- Melanomas originate from melanocytes, which arise from the neural crest
	- Usually not considered neuroectodermal
- Small-cell lung carcinomas are also neurosecretory-like
	- Likely originated from endodermal cell populations, but lost their epithelial characteristics to take on neureectodermal characteristics

# Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma

## American cancer society

- Hodgkin lymphoma marked by the presence of the Reed-Sternberg cell, usually derived from B lymphocytes
- Non-Hodgkin lymphoma is all lymphomas that aren't Hodgkin Lymphoma
- Exposures linked to NHL lymphoma
	- Benzene, herbicides, and insecticides
	- Past chemotherapy (very likely confounded by health history)
	- Drugs used to treat rheumatoid arhtritis e.g. methotrexate and tumor necrosis factor inhibitors
	- Radiation
	- Weakened immune system
	- Autoimmune disease
	- Infection with human T-cell lymphotropic virus (HTLV-1)
		- Common in Japan and the Caribbean, but not in US
	- Infection with the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)
		- In US, only significant among those with HIV
	- Infection with herpes virus 8 (HHV-8), also known as Kaposi sarcoma-associated herpes virus (KSHV), leads primary effusion lymphoma (rare)
		- Only significant among those with HIV
	- Infection with _H. pylori_ linked with mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) lymphoma of the stomach
	- Infection with _Chlamydophila psittaci_, which causes the lung disease called _psittacosis_, linked with MALT lymphoma around the eye
	- Infection with _Campylobactor jejuni_ linked with MALT around the small intestine
		- Endemic to the Mediterranean
	- Long-term infection with the hepatitis C virus
	- Obesity

## InterLymph

- Large case-control study including data collected by member studies from the International Lymphoma Epidemiology Consortium (InterLymph), Europe (De Sanjose et al. 2008)
- Cigarette smoking associated with follicular lymphoma, but not other NHL subtypes (Morton et al. 2005)
- Positive association with hairdresser profession and farming (Slager et al. 2014)

## Reviews

- Fisher and Fisher (2004) and MÃ¼ller et al. (2005)
	- More common among males than females
	- More common among white folks than black folks
	- Malignancies typically diagnosted for those 50 years or older
	- Cancer incidence and mortality for NHL have ben increasing, even as those for cancers in general have been decreasing
	- Subtypes segregate by geography.. link to viral endemicity?

## Occupational exposure

- Most of the work done for farmers, farm workers, and their households
- Barry et al. (2011)
	- Population-based cohort study of rowmen in Connecticut
	- Strong result for chlorinated solvents, carbon tetrachlrodie, dichloromethane
- Fritschi et al. (2005)
	- Case control, exposure to solvents (other than Benzene), metals, organic dusts, and PCBs
	- Australia
	- All null
- Wang et al. (2008)
	- Populaton-based case-control of women in Connecticut
	- Clorinated solvents, formaldehyde
	- Null/borderline
- Hidajat et al. (2018)
	- Cancer mortality risk in a cohort study with subdistribution hazard ratios
	- Competing risks analysis; exposure to N-nitrosamines
- Purdue et al. (2011)
	- Case-control
	- Significant/borderline results for Tricholorethylene
	
## Mirer 2003

- Straight, soluble, and semi-synthetic MWFs all share a common oil exposure
- Synthetic MWFs have no oil, but contain similar non-oil components as soluble and semi-synthetic MWFs
